This document introduces the recent release notes for TapData Community. For more information on earlier versions, please refer to the [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/tapdata/tapdata/releases).

## 3.12

### New Features

- Dameng have passed the TapData certification testing process and have been upgraded to [Certified Data Sources](../prerequisites/supported-databases.md), offering richer features and higher production stability.
- For [PostgreSQL](../prerequisites/on-prem-databases/postgresql.md) data sources, incremental data synchronization is now supported using the walminer plugin, catering to more use cases.
- Data replication tasks now support reading from multiple tables simultaneously, improving parallel processing capabilities and task execution efficiency.

### Feature Enhancements

- Significantly enhanced data synchronization performance.
- Optimized the layout and structure of menu entries.
- Improved error messages and high-risk operation warnings.
- For data sources that do not support hash validation, hash validation is now disabled by default.
- After full sync tasks are completed, restarting the task will trigger a full resynchronization to ensure data consistency.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where some task monitoring metrics were lost after task completion.
- Fixed a query efficiency issue caused by missing necessary indexes in the intermediate database, reducing data scan volume.
- Fixed an issue where selecting "Show only different fields" when downloading data validation discrepancies resulted in downloading all fields.
- Fixed a problem where task editing could get stuck during model generation, improving the task editing experience.
- Fixed an issue where, after stopping a data replication task in the incremental phase and restarting it, the full completion time displayed incorrectly.
- Fixed an issue with TDengine where SQL statement length exceeded limits when writing to super tables with many fields.
- Fixed an error occurring in data transformation tasks using TDengine as a source when the table name contained Chinese characters.
- Fixed potential exceptions when running mining tasks on PostgreSQL data sources.
- Fixed an issue in Oracle to Doris shared mining tasks where source table DDL events could not be parsed.
- Fixed specific exception issues during the incremental phase of MongoDB to Kafka data transformation tasks.
- Fixed an issue where an unexpected `_id` field appeared in the model when synchronizing MongoDB oplog to Kafka.
- Fixed an issue where MongoDB oplog data replication tasks could not replicate properly during synchronization.

## 3.11

### New Features

- Enhanced [Data Transformation Task Configuration](../user-guide/data-development/create-task.md) to support reloading of single table models in the source node model preview area, improving loading efficiency.
- Introduced time detection functionality that automatically detects the time difference between the engine deployment server and the database server and displays it on the task monitoring page.

### Optimizations

* User-defined field business descriptions can now be directly displayed in the column name position of the table sample data.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where MongoDB database cursor timeout prevented normal full synchronization.
- Fixed an issue where the custom SQL filter switch could not be turned on in the source node data filtering settings.

## 3.10

### New Features

- Added a [Union Node](../user-guide/copy-data/process-node.md#union node) to data replication tasks, enabling the merging (UNION) of multiple tables within the same database. This is useful for data integration and analysis scenarios.
- [Doris](../prerequisites/warehouses-and-lake/doris.md) data source now supports certificate-free HTTPS connections.
- MySQL, Oracle, OpenGauss, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL data sources now support enabling the **Hash Sharding** feature in the advanced settings of nodes during task configuration, significantly improving the full data sync speed for large tables.
- Added support for [VastBase](../prerequisites/on-prem-databases/vastbase.md) data source, with a maturity level of Beta, further enriching the variety of data sources.

### Enhancements

- Improved synchronization logic for time zone fields.

### Bug Fixes

- Addressed the unclear error messages and lack of detailed information in the error codes when the source MySQL does not support incremental.
- Corrected the format of task warning alerts.
- Resolved an issue where imported tasks showed running records and the current running record status appeared as "deleting."
- Addressed an issue where editing tasks incorrectly modified the association key when the target table association key was set.
- Fixed a potential failure when removing fields in Python nodes.
- Resolved an issue where deleting the primary node in master-slave merge operations caused configuration errors in the master-slave merge node, leading to task errors.
- Fixed garbled text issue with Chinese node names in tasks when a source-side DDL occurs and the engine server is not set to UTF character encoding.

## 3.9.0

### New Features

* Added a new button for using shared mining when creating [Shared Caches](../user-guide/advanced-settings/share-cache.md), simplifying cache task configuration and improving the efficiency and flexibility of cache sharing.

### Enhancements

* Added field restriction configuration parameters for the ElasticSearch data source.
* Optimized exception handling logic when enabling the preimage capability for the MongoDB data source.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where some task event statistics might occasionally be missing when reported.
- Fixed an issue where shared cache tasks without shared mining might encounter errors due to exceeding the log time window if data does not change upon restarting or upgrading the engine.
- Fixed an issue where the unset operation on the source table could cause task errors in scenarios where the write mode is updating sub-documents.
- Fixed an issue where joining collections with time types in MongoDB and MySQL caused errors.
- Fixed an issue where incremental update events unexpectedly performed lookups in master-slave merge scenarios.
- Fixed conflict errors when modifying columns in master-slave merge nodes.

## 3.8.0

### Enhancements

* Improved the display of primary keys and indexes in the task's table model.
* Enhanced the model deduction logic, supporting model deduction directly in the engine.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where some exceptions were ignored during data source error handling.
* Fixed an issue where aggregation tasks using time fields as join keys could not backtrack data.
* Fixed an issue with delayed times in mining tasks.
* Fixed an issue where MySQL as a source would consume a large amount of database memory during initial synchronization of large tables.

## 3.7.0

### New Features

* Introduced Mock Source and Mock Target data sources for data migration testing scenarios.

### Enhancements

* Improved the interaction logic for skipping errors when starting tasks.
* Improved the loading speed of the connection list.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed inconsistencies between the task runtime model and configuration model.
* Fixed inaccurate task event statistics after filtering source data.
* Fixed timezone handling issues in Oracle and PostgreSQL synchronization scenarios.
* Fixed an issue where heartbeat task reset failures could prevent related tasks from starting.
