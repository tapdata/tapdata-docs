  - **JS Node** processing performance improved.
  - **Field processing** node processing performance improved.
  - **Master-slave merge** node performance improved.
  - **Field editing** node frontend display optimization in multi-field scenarios.
- Optimized data type boundary prompts and handling logic.
- Connection management filter bar database type dropdown supports search and clear selection.
- Error code pop-ups now offer a one-click copy feature for the error stack.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues with incremental metrics lacking incremental time points for polling sources.
- Fixed an issue where model changes forcibly delete updated fields.
- Fixed node configuration issues for type modification, field addition/deletion, and field renaming; configurations are reset when loading the model.
- Fixed errors occurring when turning on the full custom switch and the target is MongoDB.



## V3.0

### New Features

- [Integrated GraphQL capability](../user-guide/data-service/query-via-graphql.md), enriching API query methods.
- Added [application categorization capability for APIs](../user-guide/data-service/create-api-service.md), facilitating categorization based on business.
- Introduced [time calculation processing node](../user-guide/data-development/process-node.md#Time Field Injection) for flexible handling of discrepancies in source and destination database time zones.
- Introduced [full-scale partitioning capability](best-practice/full-breakpoint-resumption.md), currently only supported for MongoDB.

### Enhancements

- [Shared cache function](../user-guide/advanced-settings/share-mining.md) improved, offering an observable page to monitor mining progress and troubleshoot failures.
- [Full custom query function](../user-guide/data-development/create-task.md) relaxed the restriction of only using JS nodes, now allowing the addition of other processing nodes with the node model directly utilizing the source table's model.
- The field [processing node](../user-guide/data-development/process-node.md) supporting operations like adding/deleting fields, type modifications, and renaming fields now includes a field search function.
- Adjusted wording for Schema loading frequency configuration in connection settings.
- Optimization of table name modification logic in the **Table Editing Node**; removed the apply button for direct configuration effectiveness.
- During the startup of the management process (frontend), it now includes heapDump and stackTrace parameters, similar to the synchronization governance process.
- Introduced task editing versioning to prevent overwriting of higher-version configurations by lower versions when multiple users edit the same task.
- Documentation on the right side of the data source configuration now supports image enlargement.
- Implementation of error codes for Oracle data sources.
